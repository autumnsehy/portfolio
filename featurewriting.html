    <h2 class="posttitle"> SPRINGDALE RESIDENT HOPES FOR FIRST ARKANSAS DEMOCRATIC HOUSE NOMINATION IN 20 YEARS </h2>
      <br/>
    <p>SPRINGDALE— There isn’t a manual on how to tell two children their parents have been deported.</p>

<p>The oldest child, 16, was in track practice at Springdale High School in Springdale.
Arkansas National Dreamers volunteer Irvin Camacho and another volunteer asked the track coach if they could speak to the boy.</p>
<p>“We weren’t trained on this,” he thought.  Camacho was just 19, so close in age he could have been in school with him.</p>
<p>Federal officials raided the bakery that morning, Camacho and the volunteer told him. They took five people, including your parents. They’re all going to be deported.
  The boy was expressionless.</p>
<p>Another volunteer spoke to the daughter, just six. Camacho returned to his office and called friends and family to find a place for the children to stay. Again, he thought,“We weren’t trained on this.”
Eventually, Camacho said, remembering the moment from five years ago, the children had relatives they could stay with. Their parents came back from Mexico a few years later. Camacho has worked with many immigrants who aren’t as lucky.
Camacho now wants to reform immigration and help the children of immigrants who have lived in America almost their entire lives receive citizenship.
He’s running for Arkansas House Representatives, District 89, which consists partially of Springdale. A Democrat hasn’t won the district in 20 years, a Hispanic has never won the district and Camacho, at 24, would be one of the youngest Arkansas representatives. He also has a full-time job calling clients at a call center.
  There are no old campaigns in Springdale he can look to for guidance. This isn’t deterring him.</p>
<p>“When you see this all build up,” Camacho said, “when you know you have the ability to change things, there was no reason to not run for office. I had to.”</p>
    <p>——————————————————————--</p>
<p>It’s the summer of 2016. The phone rang. Political consultant Aaron Gibson, 22, who works with Camacho, answered. He sat in the room of the Springdale Democrats office. Political posters lined the walls, ranging from the local Hillary Clinton campaign to Camacho’s.
It was another person telling them how their campaign won’t work. Every time Gibson receives a phone call like this he becomes annoyed. He’s even formulated a response.
It’s something like this: “Sure, some Democrats have tried to run for office, but nobody has done what we are doing. This is the fastest growing region in Arkansas. Irvin isn’t a random person thrown into this race from Little Rock but somebody who grew up in Springdale and understands the community.”
Gibson said there’s longstanding tension between Little Rock and Northwest Arkansas Democrats, that “more Democrats are in Little Rock and Democrats historically raise more money in Little Rock. They like to think we’re just Don Quixote.”
  What makes Camacho different, Gibson said, is his energy.</p>
    <p>He says he sees this most when Camacho is walking door-to-door, called canvassing.</p>
<p>“There’s this one time we were out canvassing,” Gibson said, “and some people had a mannequin in their house. They let Irvin in and talk to the mannequin like he was talking to him about the campaign. He’s not boring to canvas with like some politicians.”</p>
<p>Canvassing is Camacho’s favorite activity, Gibson said. He can’t canvass all the time. 
  Sometimes he has to call potential voters or donors after spending all day working at a call center.</p>
<p>“If I had to work as much as him,” Gibson said, 
  “with a full-time job and then another full-time job as an activist, I’d run myself into the ground.”</p>
      <p>_______________________</p>
<p>In 2014 Camacho marched in the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King’s march in Selma, Alabama. He marched alongside Dolores Huerta, a civil rights leader who worked alongside civil rights leader Cesar Chavez in reforming California and Federal labor laws in the United Farm Workers of America (UFW).
  He smiled before speaking about this moment. He spoke faster.</p>
<p>“It was amazing, it was crazy that I got to march with them,” he said, “because my dad was a member of the UFW and got to march with them, and then I could do the same thing after he passed away.”
  His dad taught him “to stand up for people being oppressed.”</p>
<p>Camacho was born in California and lived there with his parents from 1992 to 2003. In 2003 his family moved to Springdale.</p>
<p>He said his father, along with his work in activism, pushed him to work for immigrants’ rights throughout his teen years. When Camacho was in high school a friend of his invited Camacho to meet Juan Mendez, who Camacho nicknames “the granddaddy of the Dream Act in Arkansas.” Meeting Mendez and influence from his father pushed Camacho to work with the DREAM Act in Arkansas.  It’s an act that would allow children of all immigrants in the United States to go to college, receive driver’s licenses and social security numbers. However, the act was put into what Camacho calls a hiatus due to lawsuits.
Mendez was 29 when Camacho met him. 
  Camacho said working to promote the DREAM Act and help immigrants gave him the strength to work as a social activist.</p>
<p>“That’s what activism does,” Camacho said. 
  “It puts you in situation where you have to become fearless sometimes because no one’s really there to help you out.”</p>
      <p>______________</p>
<p>Bailey Sexton, legislative coordinator and President of the Arkansas Young Democrats, works on the campaign with Camacho.
  She’s 19. She helps Camacho with daily work, calling people, finding people to speak with.
  She’s not actually a part of the campaign but a hired member of the Democratic party assigned to work with Camacho.</p>
<p>“We’re young,” Sexton said, “and that makes us a lot different from other people running this race. Irvin’s only 24. 
  He has a full time job. He works at a call center and makes calls all day. Then he goes back here to call people some more.”</p>
<p>Camacho was sitting across from her. She spoke about how sometimes this makes Camacho frustrated and both Camacho and Sexton laughed, poking fun at each other.
  Sexton said their age helps with social media. She pointed to the Facebook page of the campaign.</p>
<p>It is the second-highest liked page for a representative in Arkansas. His most recent video, on August 19, has over 12,000 views.</p>
      <p>___________________________</p>
<p>In March of 2016 Hispanic Texas Representative Joaquin Castro’s visited Camacho to help with the campaign. They participated in a rally. Camacho’s the first person to speak, and he gives the speech in both English and Spanish.
Sexton, who doesn’t speak Spanish, said Camacho taught her how to tell people they need to sign up to vote in Spanish.</p>
      <p>“I want to include everyone,” Camacho said. “Not just the people with money or power.”</p>
<p>Springdale, Camacho said, is build for a minority leader to win. According to the US census, 42 percent of Camacho’s district is Hispanic or Latino.
Representatives have three months where they are required to go to Little Rock and perform legislative duties. 
  Gibson said, in the past, that representatives of District 89 would go to Little Rock,
  “spend their three months, pick up a check and go home. Irvin doesn’t want to do that.”</p>
<p>It’s easy to see how Camacho likes working in the community. 
  He lists all the things he wants to do with community members if he’s elected.
  He said he wants to work with local organizations, visit schools and talk individually to help people in town.</p>
<p>“People here don’t really believe in politicians,” Camacho said. 
  “They have really bad trust issues, in places like Mexico, in places like El Salvador, 
  these countries are filled with politicians who are greedy and only want money who kill a bunch of people.”</p>
      <p>Camacho doesn’t like calling himself a politician. He prefers the title public servant.</p>
<p>“When I went to Little Rock to apply for office, something strange happened,” Camacho said.
  “The man asked me what district I was running for, and I told him.  He said, 
  ‘oh, the representative there now owns some businesses in Springdale, what businesses do you own?’”</p>
      <p>Camacho raised his hands as if looking through a packet of paper.</p>
      <p>“You don’t need to own a business to be a representative,” he said.</p>
<p>He explained how representatives have historically targeted wealthy people in Springdale for voting, 
  and said “the representatives tended to ignore minority groups because they don’t vote as much.”</p>
<p>“I don’t care how much money or power people have,” Camacho said. 
  “It’s my job to listen to everybody in town. 
  This campaign, it’s like a blueprint.
  It’s to show minorities in Springdale that they can make changes to immigration or create a more welcoming community.
  It’s to encourage people to know they can do something to change oppression here.”</p>

      <h2 class="posttitle"> LOCAL DANCER TRIES TO COMBINE CIRCUS AND ART </h2>
      <br/>
      <p>She’s high in the air, lying in between two floor-length silks,
        cocooned between them like a caterpillar and waiting for the music to start.<br />
Brittany Paul, an aerial silk dancer, was rehearsing for an upcoming performance for
        the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art. Eric Jackson, 26, her partner for 
        the performance and a juggler, stood below Jackson in the large Yoga Daze studio. 
        He performed trick after trick, sometimes including Paul by throwing her sacks.<br />
“I’m trying to create more fusion acts,” Paul said. “To really show off the art.”<br />
Jackson said finding a market for a circus act is difficult,
        while Paul said she’s finding more and more places to perform and that aerial dance is seen more of as an art. Her act with Jackson blends the line between circus and art to create an act that sells better than circus alone.<br />
Paul said she was nervous to work in performing arts. 
        She began as a rock climbing instructor at Yoga Deza studio in Fayetteville.<br />
“I didn’t officially decide to work in performance arts because I didn’t believe I could,”
        Paul said. “Not until I had some experience under my belt, which wasn’t until recently.”<br />
The confusion between art and circus rests on the walls of her studio. On one wall rests acrobatic hoops.
        On the other rests a rock climbing wall. Two murals of hindu gods are painted against the remaining two walls.<br />
“I was a ceramics major at the University of Arkansas,” Paul said. 
        “There’s not many opportunities for people at the University to study dance, there’s no dance major or anything.
        I would see people dancing and expressing with their bodies on campus and I’d think, ‘that’s what I want to do.’”<br />
Jackson said he has more trouble finding work than Paul.<br />
“Beyond a couple of shows this next week, I’ll be looking for a more typical job,” Jackson said. 
        “The market is challenging because people and venues don’t take the circus arts as seriously as a
        respectable art form as more northern cities.”<br />
Jackson said the market for performing arts in Northwest Arkansas is growing,
        but doesn’t reach the levels of the market in cities that close but more northern, like Kansas City.<br />
“Juggling isn’t seen as a high art,” Jackson said,
        “but more kitschy and silly, and certainly not worth real time or funding by a lot of people.
        If there was more respect for the arts, and a greater need and push for the performing arts, 
        then it would be a good career path.
        But that’s just not something you’re likely to see in places like Arkansas anytime soon.”<br />
Both Jackson and Paul mentioned the Walton Arts Center and said the center could help local acts by bringing in fewer foreign acts. 
        Representatives from the center did not respond for comments.<br />
Even though Paul has found a market to do aerial,
        she has trouble with potential students differentiating between aerial dance and the trendy aerial yoga. 
        She said she has to turn down customers looking for aerial yoga classes. 
        The difference, she said, is that aerial yoga is not an art.<br />
“That’s why this can be called vertical theater,” Paul said.
        “There’s so much you can do in the air, with hoops and with the silks. What I do is aerial dance.
        It has it’s own rules; it’s strict. That’s what I like about it.”<br />
The strictness, she said, is similar to classical dance.
        According to the website Dancers’ Group, aerial dance originated when ballet instructors
        in France would attach wires to pointe dancers who danced on their toes. 
        Paul said that, while she has not had trouble finding places to perform recently,
        being in the United States is a disadvantage.<br />
“Lots of people who do Aerial, mostly in Europe, they have places they can go with silks set up and not worry about their space,” 
        Paul said. “I had to buy the silks on my own. And I had to raise the money to set it up. 
        We had to have the roof inspected. That was $450. I had to learn the math with the rigging, 
        to know how much weight the silks can hold and what you can and can’t do on them.”<br />
While Paul insists that aerial dance is an art, she also calls her group of performers a circus troupe.
        University of Arkansas senior Anna Shipman said she tries to go to performing art events in town,
        but often has trouble finding where they are, due to the confusing nature of art events.<br />
“Even if I know of an event in town, I don’t know where it is,” Shipman said. 
        “It’s hard to find the events and then also find out where they are.”<br />
This confusion hasn’t stopped Paul from finding gigs- she has three more in the next month. 
        They’re not easy, Paul said, because of trying to work with other circus performers to create art. 
        She has a specific style of choreographing that doesn’t always connect well with other artists.<br />
“I have to imagine how it will look,” Paul said. “I have to do it and see what works and then try again. 
        And I also watch it on video to see what works and doesn’t. That’s the hardest part about collaborating. 
        Everybody choreographs differently. Once we figure out how to work together, that’s when we can create art.”</p>
