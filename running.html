<p>The University of Arkansas track team is one of the fastest in the world.</p>

<p>I've been lucky enough to practice and race alongside Olympians, world champions and NCAA champions. My goal freshman year was to become a track and cross country superstar. That dream left when I learned my body couldn't handle the high mileage required for distance athletes- and I wasted two years training long distance when I should have been with the sprinters.</p>

<p>My goal changed midway through freshman year. I had the opportunity to learn from some of the fastest runners in the world. They could teach me what it took to be a champion. If I couldn't be the fastest then I would learn what made then the fastest and apply it to the other aspects in my life.</p>

<p>What makes a great runner? Dedication. The kind that's borderline extreme and normal- the best runners still know they are human and don't beat themselves for what they can't control.</p>

<p>Competitiveness. If you're best isn't good enough then you have to try harder.</p>

<p>The ability to make mistakes. Just because you broke a record doesn't mean you ran well. There's always room for improvement. That said, you always have to be aware of your limits. Mental health is a problem among female athletes and a healthy body and mind is essential to performing well.</p>

<p>Those are my favorite aspects of what I've learned these four years of running. Even though I didn't achieve my goal of superspeed, I will always consider the painful practices and races some of the greatest learning moments of my life.</p>
