    <h2 class="posttitle"> My favorite essay. Ever. </h2>
      <br/>
      <p> *Explanation. This essay is supposed to answer a question using passages from books we read over the semester in a 
        nonfiction class. The question is supposed to be something the reader discovers. Every third writing is mine. 
        I provide the question I am answering with bibliographic information on where the passages came from at the end of the essay</p>

Storytelling can be traced back to Hindu sacred writings, known as Vedas, from around 1400 b.c.<br />
 <br />

Because we prize tolerance and diversity of belief, nowhere in our liberal arts analysis do we want to claim that one guy’s interpretation is true and the other guy’s is false or bad.<br />
Which is fine, except we also never end up talking about just where these individual templates and beliefs come from, meaning where they come from inside the two guys.<br />
As if a person’s most basic orientation toward the world and the meaning of his experience were somehow automatically hardwired, like height or shoe size, or absorbed from the culture, like language.<br />

My twin and I used to sit next to each other in bed while my dad read. He wouldn’t read the typical books a parent would read to children. By the time I was eight years old we had heard the complete Sherlock Holmes works, Alice in Wonderland, and The Wind and the Willows.<br />
There was something about our dad’s storytelling that was more exciting than our own, but I don’t remember those nights well.<br />

 At the time I began writing these pages, in October 2004, I still did not understand how or why or when John died. I had been there. I had watched while the EMS team tried to bring him back. I still did not know how or why or when. In early December 2004, almost a year after he died, I finally received the autopsy report and emergency room records I had first requested from New York Hospital on the fourteenth of January, two weeks after it happened and one day before I told Quintana that it had happened. One reason it took eleven months to receive these records, I realized when I looked at them, was that I myself had written the wrong address on the hospital’s request form.<br />

 By 1858, it was clear that the frescoes were quickly fading from the walls and were on the verge of disappearing. “The only remedy for all is now to whitewash, and I shall be happy to hear of its application,” Dante Gabriel Rossetti said that year, having lost all interest in the project. Thus, for the last century and a half, these Pre-Raphaelite frescoes have haunted the walls of the Union library, gradually becoming less and less decipherable (in spite of various expensive restoration projects), their fame resting upon their illegibility.<br />

Dad read stories almost every night until we were in second grade. My brother doesn’t remember them.<br />
 I urged him when we were in middle school to remember sometime last year. He thought he could recall a night listening to Charlotte’s Web. After a few minutes he provided evidence to solidify the memory and was certain it was true.<br />
 The first time we saw each other after moving apart for college I reminisced with him. He brought up the memory of Charlotte’s Web.<br />
 I don’t have the heart to tell him that dad never read us that book.<br />
 <br />

 On well-defined terms I felt free to get lost within myself, territory that otherwise felt increasingly foreign and un-friendly. I even enjoyed getting lost in the streets, sometimes pitching myself deep into unknown trails and suburbs just so I could find my way out.<br />
 In this way I threaded through otherwise unpatterned hours, stitching their surface with a design that described time without being of it. The afternoons had no such scheme, so that the clock and I slipped, each day, into dull antagonism.<br />
 <br />

 Everything in my own immediate experience supports my deep belief that I am the absolute center of the universe, the realest most vivid and important person in existence.<br />
 We rarely think about this sort of natural basic self-centeredness, because it’s pretty much the same for all of us, deep down.<br />
 It is our default setting, hardwired into our boards at birth.<br />
 Think about it: There is no experience you’ve had that you were not at the absolute center of.<br />
 <br />

 <br />
 We have a rule at home. It’s to not tell mom when we eat at fast food restaurants with dad unless she asks.<br />
 One time when I was five I broke this rule and she became furious. My dad told me that I had made her so angry she would blow up if I said anything else. I kept silent and believed she would explode.<br />
 I’ve never told her of the lie dad said because I don’t want her to remember that day.<br />

 The next time Lenny and I were in an ICU at Cedars together it was to see her and Nick’s daughter Dominique, who had been strangled outside her house in Hollywood. “She looks even worse than Diana did,” Lenny whispered when she saw Dominique, her intake of breath so sudden that I could barely hear her. I knew what Lenny was saying. Lenny was saying that Diana had not lived. Lenny was saying that Dominique was not going to live. I knew this- I suppose I knew it from the time the police officer who called identified himself as “Homicide”-but did not want to hear anyone say it.<br />
 <br />

 “She felt defeated,” Diana said. “When prosecutors go for death, they are so driven to ‘win’ that they forget what ‘winning’ means. They’re so geared for death that even a sentence of life without parole seems unsatisfying. Take this kind of behavior out of the courtroom and it sounds a lot like blood revenge: Only death will do.”<br />
 Denny, who has faced such prosecutors in Louisiana courts for thirteen years, adds, “That’s one reason why the death penalty is not good for our society. It tends to corrupt the sensibilities of the prosecutors, especially if they feel that getting death sentences enhances their careers.”<br />

 My sorority sister takes hours to edit an Instagram post. She told me once that she has to look perfect on her profile. I know now to look at her posts with skepticism.<br />
 <br />
13.<br />
 Just as in a good Hitchcock picture, everything is illusionary.<br />
 <br />

 It’s a word with as complicated a history as the most road-battered feet. Derived in English circa the thirteenth century as a term of penitential punishment, discipline comes from the Old French descepline, meaning variously physical punishment, teaching, suffering, and martyrdom. The Old French derivation’s direct Latin root, disciplina (instruction given, teaching, learning, knowledge), is itself the heir of what we know more directly from the Bible as discipulus, or “disciple”-the object of instruction; pupil, student, follower- which is in turn derived from the compound discipere, meaning to analyize thoroughly, to grasp intellectually. Where things really go pear-shaped is the breakdown of discipere into dis, meaning “apart” and capere, “to take, to take hold of,” also the root verb of capable. <br />
 <br />

 My dad and I listen to Freaks and Geeks radio during night car rides. It’s our nickname for the show. I don’t know the actual name.<br />
 We gave it that nickname because of the topic. The host interviews people who write about the supernatural or he listens to callers who speak about the supernatural.<br />
 One time on our way home the host interviewed a geek who researched ghosts. “There are dimensions we can’t perceive,” the Geek said. “And I think that’s where we go when we die. We are disciplined to think that ghosts are in our own dimension.”<br />
 <br />
16.<br />
 The silence lengthened, and finally I said, “I think we should banish all further mention of the words ‘literature’ and ‘literary’ and ‘literai.’” I knew that the host had been briefed about what kind of writers we were and what we wanted to discuss. But he had no other frame of reference. “Tell me,” he said. “What insights do you all have about the literary experience in America today?” Silence also greeted this question. Finally I said, “We’re here to talk about the craft of writing.”<br />
 <br />

 The line between fact and fiction is fuzzier than most people find it convenient to admit. There is the commonsensical assertion that while the novelist is engaged on a work of the creative imagination, the duty of the journalist is to tell what really happened, as it happened. That distinction is easy to voice but hard to sustain in logic. For imagination and memory are Siamese twins, and you cannot cut them so cleanly apart. There’s a good case for arguing that any narrative account is a form of fiction. The moment you start to arrange the world in words, you alter its nature. The words themselves begin to suggest patterns and connections that seemed at the time to be absent from the events the words describe.<br />
 <br />

My mind inhibits me from sleeping. Stories help because they keep me focused.<br />
 My method of sleep began when I was eight. I would lie in bed and begin to imagine myself in worlds similar to C.S Lewis’s The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe. Instead of losing control of the stories my mind would continue to tell them and I would backtrack or skip passages as I wished.<br />
 Scientists call this phenomenon lucid dreaming. I still dream this way. In October my stories always end up about what would happen if I turned into a witch on Halloween. One time an alarm woke me while I was trying to tell my best friend of my magic.<br />
 I reached for my phone to text my friend. Guess what! I typed. Then I deleted the message.<br />
 That wasn’t the first time I had confused my dream with reality.<br />
 <br />
19.<br />
The social worker lived in Los Angeles, she had to know what vibora meant, vibora in Los Angeles meant snake and snake in Los Angeles meant rattlesnake. I was relatively certain that the rattlesnake was a fantasy but I nonetheless guided Arcelina and Quintana inside, then turned to the social worker. It’s a game, I lied. Arcelina pretends she sees a snake. We all laugh. Because you can see. There is no snake.<br />
 <br />

 What I’m saying is that I have no patience with the snobbery that says nonfiction is only journalism by another name and that journalism by any name is a dirty word. While we’re redefining literature, let’s also redefine journalism. Journalism is writing that first appears in any periodic journal, whatever its constituency. Lewis Thomas’s first two books, Lives of a Cell and The Medusa and the Snail, were first written as essays for the New England Journal of Medicine. Historically, in America, good journalism becomes good literature. H.L Mencken, Ring Lardner, Joseph Mitchell, Edmund Wilson and dozens of other major American writers were working journalists before they were canonized in the church of literature. They just did what they did best and never worried about how it was defined.<br />
 <br />
21.<br />
 Stories have a tendency to change the more you repeat them. After a while you lose the reality of the story and it becomes fiction.<br />
 <br />
22.<br />
 When a writ of appeal came to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals to review this process, did they agree there was a pattern of racial discrimination?<br />
 They refused to examine it.<br />
 <br />
23.<br />
I did not want to finish the year because I know that as the days pass, as January becomes February and February becomes summer, certain things will happen. My image of John at the instant of his death will become less immediate, less raw. It will become something that happened in another year. My sense of John himself, John alive, will become more remote, even “mudgy,” softened, transmuted into whatever best serves my life without him. In fact this is already beginning to happen.<br />
 <br />

 When a boy introduced himself to me at freshman orientation I repeated the wrong name back.<br />
 <br />

If my forgeries are hung long enough in a museum they become real.<br />

      <p>A Study on “What is Poetry”<br />
Produced by Autumn Sehy on May 5, 2014<br />
And received by Dr. Heffernan on May 6, 2014</p>

<h3>
Goal: This study was conducted on the basis of understanding the simple question:<br />
What is poetry?</h3>

<h3>Procedure: Write about what poetry is, survey many styles of poetry. Ask oneself, “is this a poem.”</h3>

        <h3>Supplies: A computer and google and an apt mind</h3>


<br/>
        <br/>
        <h3>Data:</h3><br />
<p>What is poetry?<br />
Is poetry the ability to rhyme?<br />
The ability to write in a line?<br />
The ability to cut off a<br />
Sentence when it’s halfway<br />
Through?<br />
The ability to say something<br />
That makes no sense:<br />
I believe we’re even,<br />
  Don’t you?</p>
      <br/>
<p>Poetry &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; could be<br />
The ability to make pictures<br />
Out of a set of words and say<br />
The picture has some<br />
Kind of meaning.<br />
Poetry could<br />
Be love<br />
?<br />
  <br/>
I.<br />
Could call.<br />
Poetry an art.<br />
I.<br />
Could call.<br />
Poetry a science.<br />
I.<br />
Could call.<br />
This “meaningful repetition.”</p>
<br/>
<p>Poetry could be<br />
The written study <br />
Of meter and time.</p>
<br/>
<p>Yet, I could decide to play under no rules and bounds<br />
And write in free verse and capitalize WHatever I wAnT.<br />
or not capitalize anything,<br />
but then I would be copying ee cummings.</p>
<br/>
<p>Poetry could be the sleazy rhymes and “love poems”<br />
Roses are red,<br />
Violets are blue,<br />
This poem is awful<br />
But I think it’s a poem,<br />
Don’t you?</p>
<br/>
<p>Yet poetry could be a set of three words,<br />
Such as:</p>

<p>Cat              purr <br />
Soft.</p>
<br/>
<p>Then the point of the poem may be to decide<br />
If it is a poem at all.<br />
Yet if it’s causing you to think so much with such few words,<br />
How could it not be a poem?</p>
<br/>
<p>My, a poem could also dabble on for ages and ages and use indecipherable language<br />
That only stuffy men used in the 1600’s.<br />
How dadst thy inconsiderate beast atone for thou wrongdoings?<br />
Mustn’t thou maleficent deeds go far awry upon thy landscape of<br />
Thou breatheren?<br />
My brain weeps trying to understand what they’re saying,<br />
But the old and wig-wearing men count, too.</p>
<br/>
<p>And such.<br />
And be.<br />
Be this <br />
This be?<br />
Poetry.<br />
Poetry like.<br />
Like like.<br />
Like like poetry.<br />
Gertrude Stein.</p>
<br/>
<p>However.<br />
Poetry could make complete sense and sound almost natural and book-like.<br />
Yet still be called a poem.<br />
What is the difference? Why must an essay or story have rules?<br />
Could a long book not be called<br />
An extended poem?</p>
<br/>
<p>But then there’s poems.<br />
Written in such forced time.<br />
Could not be a book.</p>
<br/>
<p>It’s similar to mathematics.<br />
A square is a rectangle,<br />
Yet a rectangle is not a square.<br />
Poetry can be calculated<br />
Like a problem.</p>
<br/>
<p>It can use<br />
A set of words<br />
At a time<br />
To convey some meaning<br />
Again and again,<br />
Yet this simple algorithm<br />
Seems to work<br />
For some of the<br />
Poets. Throwing off the scheme can make one feel wrong, and therefore make the math a poem.</p>
<br/>
<p>Yet, no matter how fun it is to decipher what a poem is,<br />
I consider it to be the written version of modern art.<br />
Somebody could take a toilet seat and call it modern art.<br />
Throw it in a museum.<br />
Sign it.<br />
See, Art!<br />
(this has been done before)</p>
<br/>
<p>The question about whether or not modern art is art is long continued and will be long lasting.<br />
And so will be the question, what is a poem?<br />
I believe that a poem is a set of words that make me think.</p>
<br/>
<p>So even<br />
 If i<br />
T<br />
 I<br />
 S<br />
 M U M B L E D<br />
Garblelikethis</p>
<br/>
<p>It could still be considered a poem<br />
Because it causes me to wonder<br />
Why the poet wrote it<br />
The way they did.</p>



      <br/>
        <br/>
<p>
Conclusion: The question, “what is poetry?” will always be under debate. 
  I am lenient on my idea of what poetry is, though others may set themselves to defined standards and call certain poems 
  “jarbles of words” instead of poetry.</p>
