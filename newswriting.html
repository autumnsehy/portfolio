    <h2 class="posttitle"> ARKANSAS ACLU OVERWHELMED WITH INMATE GREIVANCES </h2>
    <br/>
    <p>Arkansas has come a long way in inmate protection but experts say the state struggles to keep prisoners safe.<br />
 <br />
“Inmates are in a position to report if they feel they are not secure,” said Jim DePriest, chief legal counsel for the Arkansas Department of Legal Correction. “If they don’t get the response they want they can file a grievance. The grievance goes through the ranks and we have a number of systems in place to make sure inmates are safe.”<br />
 <br />
American Civil Liberties Union Legal Director Holly Dickson said the Arkansas ACLU receives more complaints than they “could possibly handle” from inmates concerned about their safety from guards. She said the Arkansas Jail Standards Commission, which records prisoner grievances, cannot do much and the generally follow up grievances that are, “in regards to physical space than with regards to violence.” DePriest said the Commission handles grievances if they are deemed justified.<br />
 <br />
“Arkansas insists on a two-tier system,” Dickson said. “They have an informal report by inmates and then a formal grievance. It’s all internal. No outsiders have access. The Arkansas Department of Corrections decides the validity of complaints. Arkansas does not have a standards board where inmates can directly complain.”<br />
 <br />
While there is not a standards board, DePriest said Arkansas provides inmates with a hotline they can call if they feel uncomfortable about anything, from the quality of their food to the crowdedness of their cell. University of Arkansas Associate Professor of Law Laurent Sacharoff said most prisoner rights are governed by federal constitution and that systems for prisoner safety are similar in each state. He said more laws are focused on the lifestyle and space of inmates because violence already, “violates civil law, state law and the constitution.”<br />
 <br />
“There’s always going to be a problem with prisoners reporting guards because of possible retaliation by guards,” Sacharoff said. “There’s also the trouble of obtaining corroborating evidence if a prisoner is violated.”<br />
 <br />
Guards at the Washington County jail undergo a system of background checks before they are hired. Washington County Public Information Officer Kelly Cantrell said the background checks include a polygraph test and searches for previous felonies through the National Crime Center Database. The jail cannot hire felons. She also said guards are subjected to this check after the hiring managers decide that guard would be suited for the job.<br />
 <br />
“You take someone’s rights away,” Cantrell said. “Guards are in control of people’s lives. They are locked down. They are in jail. They don’t have the right to leave when they want. There are a lot of federal laws they have to follow. We conduct thorough checks to make sure the guards will be safe in the environment.”<br />
 <br />
Dickson said the issue with guard violence occurs when former police officers move to prisons. According to the ACLU website, the organization believes, “good police practices, thorough training, carefully crafted policies and appropriate allocation of resources in law enforcement can ensure public safety and prevent abuses in encounters between police officers and citizens.” The ACLU website also states that many police officers protect citizens but that few officers do abuse their positions.<br />
 <br />
“Former officers who were unfit for office often move to jobs in prisons,” Dickson said. “Arkansas is not good about prosecuting these officers. There are few laws on prosecuting law enforcement. Once in prison, the leadership sets the tone of the place. If you have a few individual bad apples in leadership then violence and corruption occurs. Arkansas does not do a good job of keeping those apples in check. Good apples, on the other hand, set a good tone and atmosphere for prisons and jails and allow inmates to feel safe.”<br />
 <br />
A 1966 investigation sparked a revolution for prisoner rights in Arkansas after revealing guards torturing inmates with electric telephones, forcing inmates to work more than 14 hours at a time and refusing inmates food.<br />
 <br />
“Arkansas’s system was, in a whole, unconstitutional,” Depriest said. “Much of the department was operated by inmates, not employees.”<br />
 <br />
Gov. Orval Faubus, famous for trying to block the integration of Little Rock Central High School, ordered an investigation of Arkansas prisons in 1966 but never published the results, according to the Encyclopedia of Arkansas History and Culture. Gov. Winthrop Rockefeller stumbled upon the investigation a year later, published the results and conducted further investigations. These revealed a large amount of inmates dying from diseases they did not have before prison along with over 200 skeletons of inmates buried in Cummins Penitentiary.</p>

<p>“Yeah, there’s trouble with guards,” Dickson said.“Arkansas has a long deep rich history of violence.”</p>

<h2 class="posttitle"> SEXUAL ASSAULT REPORT RECANTED </h2>
<br/>
<p>A student who submitted a sexual assault report March 9 recanted the report two days later in a follow-up interview with police.<br />
Police investigated the report and the student said she lied about the claim, though police cannot provide reason to why the claim was recanted.<br />
“It’s unfortunate that that happens because there are true crime victims and when someone comes to the police department, we take it for truth what they tell us,” UAPD Capt. Gary Crain said. “We commit resources to find who that suspect is and bringing them to justice. Essentially, we’re committing resources and spending time on something that never happened, which is unfortunate.”<br />
Anne Shelley, executive director of the Northwest Arkansas Rape Crisis Center, said that false reports harm actual sexual assault or rape victims.<br />
“It makes it difficult for all the folks we serve who are survivors of sexual assault,” Shelley said. “It feeds into the idea from society as a whole that you can’t believe the victim, so anything that is harmful to survivors of sexual assault matters to us.”<br />
Only about 40 percent of sexual assaults are reported in the first place, Shelley said.<br />
“Our fear becomes ‘Is this going to keep someone else from reporting because they fear they won’t be believed?’”<br />
Shelley also said that it’s difficult for victims to report sexual assault or rape because about 70 to 90 percent of perpetrators are friends of the victims.<br />
“I think we hear about false reports because we live in a culture where we won’t always believe the victim,” Shelley said. “When we have a false report, it seems like there seems to be a cultural norm that they must be lying. The truth is that not a lot of people lie about this. It is a very traumatic event when it does happen.”<br />
Both the NWA Rape Crisis Center and Pat Walker Health Center provide services for victims of sexual assault. NWA Rape Crisis Center provides advocacy, counseling, group support and education. STAR Central, or Support, Training, Advocacy, & Resources on Sexual Assault and Relationship Violence Central, provides advocacy programs at Pat Walker Health Center.<br />
“We want students to know that STAR Central is here for them if something has happened,” said Casey Maute, assistant director of communications for Pat Walker Health Center. “We’re not here to judge the validity of a claim, we’re here to be a shoulder for the student and a listening ear. We’re going to believe what the students tell us, that’s our philosophy. If anything, we hope that students come to us if something has happened and hopefully they aren’t afraid to come forward and let us know.”<br />
Last year, a case similar to this was found to be false. In that case, Crain said the student who submitted the report was taken to court and found guilty of lying.<br />

<h2 class="posttitle"> INNOVATION CAFE PROGRAM ALLOWS STUDENTS TO CREATE RESTAURANTS</h2>
<br/>
<p>
The Innovation Cafe, which has produced campus eateries like Chef Jet and the Olympus Greek Grill, is a program that allows students to develop their own restaurant.<br />
“With the original idea, we were looking at changing the restaurant concept every year,” said Robert Harrington, an associate professor in the department of food, human nutrition and hospitality in the School of Human Environmental Sciences.<br />
“Because of the time it takes, we decided, through experience, that every eighteen months or year and a half would be better timing in terms of assessing what is working," Harrington said.<br />
Work on the Innovation Cafe began during the planning of Founders Hall, Harrington said. Harrington met with leaders of Chartwells to create the cafe.<br />
Students can take classes that work on the Innovation Cafe in the fall and spring semesters.<br />
“I was able to come up with a new idea to replace Chef Jet,” said junior Alexandria Sharum, who took the class in spring 2014. “My group came up with a Greek theme, and the people at Chartwells really liked it. I was contacted over the summer to ask if I would be interested in further developing that concept, so I enrolled in another class where I was able to do that.”<br />
Students worked in groups to develop the cafe. Sharum was a group leader.<br />

“I had to delegate tasks to other group members, which proved to be extremely helpful as there was no way one person could've done all of this on their own,” Sharum said. “It didn't really affect my perception about my future career choice as much as it just showed me that I was most definitely in the correct field for myself.”<br />
Sharum’s group decided on a Greek theme to add a healthy and otherwise nonexistent option on campus. 
Their main competition was a Mexican theme.<br />
Groups competed to create one cafe. However, Harrington and Chartwells officials are working to transform multiple areas into Innovation Cafes.<br />
“It’s a concept of restaurant development on campus,” Harrington said. 
“The Hill Grill, we’re looking at that space. Also, next to Starbucks is a Quiznos. We’re looking at how that space can be used better in the future. We have students working on those ideas and assessing how well the Greek concept is going.”<br />
Working on the Innovation Cafe allows students to work with Chartwells 
by presenting their ideas to Chartwells employees throughout the semester. 
This interaction has created more opportunities for students in the culinary field after graduation.<br />
“More and more students are interested in entrepreneurship and getting involved in the experiential
things tied to the classroom,” Harrington said.
“It’s also useful for students looking for potential employment with the Compass Group,
which is also the largest food service employer in the world. 
We have several students in their manager-in-training program that do internships with them and have taken positions with them.”</p>
