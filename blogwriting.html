      <p> So, I have good news and bad news. </p>
      <p> The good news is that I have copies of some of my blog posts from Thechicteen.com. I also have screenshots of the website over at 
        <a href="https://autumnsehy.github.io/portfolio/thechicteen"> The Chic Teen Website Page </a>
                                                                     </p>
      <p> The bad news is that I couldn't afford to keep the website running after I accidentally murdered it via trying to change the
      site name (I disliked the name thechicteen.com once I turned 20...because I wasn't a teenager anymore)</p>
      <p> The other bad news is that I'm missing one of the most-shared and award winning posts I write. I've included a copy of one
      of the posts I have, but it wasn't an award winner. It was one of my last posts. </p>

      ***
     <p>Today, I'm beginning a new series.<br />
After spending five hours in two different thrift stores (I'm so sorry thrift store employees), I figured you guys might want some of my secrets on how to shop on a budget. Growing up with a financial planner and writing for a financial website taught me a lot about what I can and cannot afford.<br />
The answer? Not much.</p>

<p>It took a while for me to realize that no matter how much I like Urban Outfitters, I can't really afford their clothes if I'm on a student's budget. That $30 t-shirt? That can be found at forever 21 for $12. Those cool sandals that cost $95? I won't be able to afford gas of the next three weeks.</p>

<p>Many of my friends have asked how I can afford to shop as much as I do. The answer is to create a budget and stick with it. I budget paycheck-by-paycheck, and have maybe $30 a month to spend on myself after groceries, rent and savings.</p>

<p>Yet, I'm still able to wear J. Crew shorts, carry leather Coach purses, and invest in trends I like. How? Through thrifting, fast fashion, and websites like Poshmark. There's little reason to pay full price on anything, and by taking some time and knowledge a $45 pair of sandals from Steve Madden you've been eyeing for the past month can be $20 and brand new.</p>

<p>Next week I'll begin with thrift shopping. Then I'll cover fast fashion before switching to bargain retail shopping. I'll end with the emerging website Poshmark, based off of the popularity of Ebay and RetailMeNot.</p>

<p>To end such a serious post, I'll leave you guys with a picture of my roommate's cat trying to climb my window.<br />
 </p>

<p>He does stuff like this often.</p>

      <p> While I worked at Stacking Benjamins
        <a href="https://www.stackingbenjamins.com/5-ways-stage-house/">I had the chance to write a post.</a>
        <p>Most of my time was there was spent writing script, editing the podcast and doing analytics and back-end technical work.</p>
